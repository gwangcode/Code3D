An interactive, zero-dependency FreeCAD workbench that provides an embedded Python terminal. It features a built-in geometry manipulation engine (Code3D) that leverages **pure FreeCAD native `Part` APIs** to enable lightning-fast procedural modeling, real-time parameter updates, and non-destructive history trees.

Write Python code directly inside FreeCAD to generate geometry, apply noise deformations, and manipulate existing Parts in real-time.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Zero-Configuration & Blazing Fast**: No external CAD kernels (like CadQuery or OCP) to download. The terminal opens instantly.
- **💻 Embedded Python Terminal**: A fully functional, dark-themed Python console docked inside FreeCAD. Supports multi-line inputs, intelligent syntax checking, and error-proof prompt protection.
- **⚡ Operator Overloading Magic**: Directly use Python's math operators on FreeCAD shapes for rapid boolean operations, transformations, and deformations.
- **🔄 Non-Destructive Parametric Modeling**: All boolean operations and deformations preserve your original models. It automatically generates native FreeCAD nodes (e.g., `Fusion`, `Cut`, `Noise`, `Twist`) and hides the source objects. You can delete the new node at any time to recover the originals!
- **🧠 Real-Time Updates**: Because we generate native parametric nodes, modifying a base object (like changing a sphere's radius) will automatically cascade and update all downstream boolean or noise operations.
- **🪨 Procedural Noise & Smoothing**: Apply natural, rocky textures to regular geometries, or generate globally smooth continuous B-Spline bodies from chaotic point clouds.
- **🖱️ Smart Object Picking**: Select any object in the FreeCAD tree and press `Ctrl + Shift + C` to instantly copy `part("object_name")` to your clipboard and terminal.
- **📜 Script Execution**: Run external Python files directly in the terminal context using `runf("path/to/script.py")`.

## 📦 Installation

### Method 1: Via FreeCAD Addon Manager (Recommended)
1. Open FreeCAD and go to **Tools → Addon Manager**.
2. Click the **Cogwheel icon** in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the following URL: `https://github.com/gwangcode/Code3D`
4. Find **Code3D Workbench** in the list and click **Install**.
5. Restart FreeCAD.

### Method 2: Manual Installation via Git
1. Navigate to your FreeCAD `Mod` directory. (You can find this by opening the FreeCAD Python console and typing `App.getUserAppDataDir()`).
2. Clone this repository directly into the `Mod` folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gwangcode/Code3D.git
   ```
3. Restart FreeCAD.

### 📢 Dependencies
This workbench runs entirely on FreeCAD's native `Part` module, so no heavy CAD kernels are required. However, `apply_noise`, `smooth_body`, and 2D boolean operations rely on the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `trimesh`
- `shapely`

If your FreeCAD Python environment is missing any of them, install them via terminal:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy trimesh shapely
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open FreeCAD and create a new document.
2. Select **Code3D Terminal** from the Workbench dropdown menu at the top.
3. The **Code3D Terminal** will appear at the bottom of the screen instantly.
4. Type Python code directly into the terminal and press `Enter`.

### Example Code

**1. Create basic shapes (Auto-named as `model_1`, `model_2`, etc.):**
```python
cube(10)
sphere(6)
```

**2. Non-Destructive Boolean Operations:**
```python
# Cut a sphere out of the cube (creates a native 'Cut' node, hides originals)
part("model_1") - part("model_2")
```

**3. Destructive In-place Transformations:**
```python
# Move model_1 by 15mm in X. Updates in-place without creating new nodes.
part("model_1") + [15, 0, 0]
```

**4. Procedural Noise & Real-time Updates:**
```python
# Apply noise to the cube. This creates a parametric 'Noise' node.
# You can modify Density and Seed in the GUI's Data panel!
apply_noise(part("model_1"), density=0.6, smoothness=1.5, amplitude=0.4)
```

**5. Generate Smooth B-Spline Bodies from Point Clouds:**
```python
# Define some unordered 3D points
pts = [(0,0,0), (10,0,5), (15,10,-2), (10,20,8), (0,20,0), (-5,10,5)]
# Generates a globally smooth, volume-preserving solid
smooth_body(pts)
```

**6. Execute an external script:**
```python
runf("D:/projects/my_complex_model.py")
```

## ⌨️ Terminal Shortcuts & Commands

Our terminal is designed to feel just like a native code REPL:

| Shortcut / Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Up` / `Down` Arrows | Browse command history. |
| `Ctrl + U` | Clear the current input line. |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo multi-line input (step back to the previous line). |
| `Ctrl + Shift + C` | **(Global)** Select an object in the tree, press this to copy `part("name")` to clipboard. |
| `Enter` | Execute the code (intelligently checks for unclosed brackets). |
| `Shift + Enter` | Force a new line without executing (enters `...` mode). |
| `clear` or `cls` | Clear the entire terminal screen. |
| `runf("path")` | Execute an external Python file in the terminal context. |

*(Note: The terminal automatically protects the `>>> ` prompt. You cannot accidentally delete it with Backspace or move the cursor past it.)*

## 🧊 Built-in Primitives Library

The Code3D engine comes with a rich set of built-in 3D and 2D primitives. All 3D primitives return a native `Part.Shape` wrapped in our magic operator proxy. 2D primitives return a `Shape2d` object which is automatically converted to a `Part.Face` for display.

🔬 Advanced Surface & Point-Cloud Algorithms
bspline_surface(points, thickness=0.0)
Generates mathematically precise B-Spline surfaces from either 1D contours or 2D point grids.

1D input [(x,y,z), ...]: Generates a closed B-Spline curve. If coplanar, fills it into a Face; if non-coplanar, returns a 3D Wire.

2D input [[(x,y,z), ...], ...]: Generates a standard B-Spline free-form surface.

Thickness: Set thickness > 0 to solidify the resulting surface into a 3D body.

smooth_body(points, iterations=3)
Generates a perfectly smooth, watertight, organic 3D solid from a chaotic, unordered list of 3D points.

Internal Pipeline:

Coplanarity Check: Gracefully degrades to a 2D planar face if all points lie on a plane.
Convex Hull: Uses trimesh to find the initial bounding volume.
Catmull-Clark Subdivision: Refines the mesh topology iteratively (iterations parameter).
Taubin Smoothing: Applies a volume-preserving Laplacian smoothing filter to eliminate sharp angles without shrinking the overall body.
Solidification: Converts the final smoothed mesh back into a valid FreeCAD Solid.
Parameters: points (List of (x,y,z) tuples), iterations (Higher = smoother but denser).

### 2. `smooth_body(points, slices=15, target_poles=30)`

This is a reverse-engineering grade algorithm that transforms **unordered, chaotic 3D point clouds** into a highly elegant, continuous, and minimal-face B-Spline solid. It is perfect for procedural rocks, organic shapes, or cleaning up scanned data.

**How it works internally:**
1.  Calculates the **Convex Hull** of all points to form a watertight raw skeleton.
2.  Detects the longest bounding box axis and auto-**Slices** the hull into `slices` layers.
3.  For each slice, it extracts the cross-section contour and **Resamples** it into `target_poles` equally spaced points.
4.  **Aligns** the orientation (CW/CCW) and the start point of every layer to prevent twisting.
5.  **Lofts** the perfectly aligned sections into a smooth NURBS solid.

**Parameters:**
*   `points`: A list of 3D points `[(x,y,z), ...]`. Must contain at least 4 non-coplanar points.
*   `slices`: Number of horizontal layers (default 15). Higher values capture more detail but increase face count.
*   `target_poles`: Number of control points per cross-section (default 30). Higher values make the cross-section smoother.

**Example:**
```python
import random

# Generate 200 random points simulating a rock or asteroid
pts = [(random.uniform(-10, 10), random.uniform(-10, 10), random.uniform(-10, 10)) for _ in range(200)]

# Automatically builds a smooth, organic B-Spline solid
smooth_body(pts, slices=20)
```

**⚠️ Caveats & Warnings:**
1.  **Convexity Limitation**: Because the algorithm uses a Convex Hull as the base, it cannot generate highly **concave** shapes (e.g., a crescent moon, a donut, or a model with deep undercuts). The resulting body will always "wrap" the outermost points.
2.  **Slice Count**: Do not set `slices` too high (e.g., > 50). If the slices are too close to each other, OCC's `makeLoft` algorithm may throw a `StdFail_NotDone` error due to insufficient separation between sections.
3.  **Point Distribution**: Ensure the point cloud is somewhat distributed in 3D. If all points lie strictly on a single line or plane, the algorithm will degrade gracefully (returning a line or a flat face).
4.  **Display Mode**: The resulting body is mathematically smooth. If it appears black and faceted in the viewport, select it and press `V, S` (or change Display Mode to `Shaded`) in FreeCAD.

## ⚡ Operator Overloading Cheatsheet

Once a shape is created or retrieved via `part("name")`, you can use the following operators:

| Operator | Syntax Example | Operation | Effect on Tree / History |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `+` | `shape + [x, y, z]` | **Translate (Positive)** | In-place update (Modifies Placement) |
| `+` | `shape1 + shape2` | **Boolean Union (Fuse)** | Non-destructive (Creates `Fusion` node) |
| `-` | `shape - [x, y, z]` | **Translate (Negative)** | In-place update (Modifies Placement) |
| `-` | `shape1 - shape2` | **Boolean Cut** | Non-destructive (Creates `Cut` node) |

| `*` | `shape1 * shape2` | **Boolean Intersection** | Non-destructive (Creates `Common` node) |
| `@` | `shape @ [rx, ry, rz]` | **Rotation** (Radians) | In-place update (Modifies Placement) |
| `%` | `shape % [sxy, sxz, syx, syz, szx, szy]` | **Shear Transformation** | Generates new static feature |
| `^` | `shape ^ [ax, ay, az]` | **Twist** (Radians per unit) | Non-destructive (Creates `Twist` node) |

## ⚙️ How it works

The workbench intercepts `sys.stdout` to display print statements and errors directly in the custom PySide text widget. 

Under the hood, the `mod3d` engine patches geometry operations to return an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). When the terminal receives the final result, it recursively translates this AST into native FreeCAD parametric features (like `Part::MultiFuse`, `Part::Cut`, and custom `Part::FeaturePython` for noise/twist). This ensures you get the extreme flexibility of Python scripting combined with the robust parametric history of the FreeCAD GUI.
